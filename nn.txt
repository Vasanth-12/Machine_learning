Neural network will be coming soon...

It will consists of
	*sigmoid_function
		-> activation function
	*derivatives of sigmoid_func
		-> derivation of activation function
	*forward Propagation
		-> weigths and activation of previous layer nodes
	*backpropagation
		-> adjusting the weights
	*and finally prediction
		-> make prediction for given values

get some mathmatical and program knowledge.
